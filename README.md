Predicting the energy output of wind turbine based on weather condition
Wind speed/power has received increasing attention around the earth due to its renewable nature as well as environmental friendliness. With the global installed wind power capacity rapidly increasing, the wind industry is growing into a large-scale business. 
Power generated by wind is highly dependent on the wind speed. Though it is highly non-linear, wind speed follows a certain pattern over a certain period of time.
To deal with the present project at hand,I need to perform energy prediction based on weather data and analyze the important parameters as well as their correlation on the energy output. To deal with the interaction of the different parameters, I will be creating a Machine Learning Model which will predict the  power output of wind farm based on the weather condition and suggest the best time to utilize the energy from wind farm.I will figure out and consider the correlation of the different variables for the energy output so as to make the model a more efficient and reliable one.
I will use Machine Learning with Python in which Multiple Linear Regression will be used along with that IBM cloud for deployment and Watson Studio also will be used.
